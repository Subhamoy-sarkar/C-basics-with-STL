Reusability is  a very important feature of OOPs
In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to in
Reusing classes saves time and money
Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same again.

What is inheritance in C++
1. The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using Inheritance.
2.We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from it
3.The existing class is called as the " Base Class ".
4.the new class which is inherited is called as the " Derived class".
5.Reusing classes saves time and money.
6.There are different types of inheritance in C++.

Forms of Inheritance in C++:
1.single inheritance (a derived class with only one Base class)
2.Multiple inheritance  ( a derived class with more than one base class)
3.hierarchical inheritance ( several derived classes from a single base class)
4.Multilevel inheritance ( Deriving a class from already derived class)
5.Hybrid inheritance ( it is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance, however , one of the parent classes is not a base class. )
